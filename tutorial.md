# Tutorial

### Demo

In this video, you will see the project we are going to build. This demo connects to an NFT on OpenSea and displays a texture on a sphere material.

### Installing SDK

In this video, you will be shown where to find the ChainSafe Gaming SDK package and also how to install this package into Unity3D.&#x20;

Install [JSON.NET](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/json-net-for-unity-11347) to fix: `The type or namespace name 'Newtonsoft' could not be found`

### SDK Prefabs

Prefabs are prebuilt components that supply pre-configured functionality. The SDK offers this for the most general operations. This video goes over the most general use cases. The example shows how to connect and NFT from a custom script on the Rinkeby test network from an NFT deployed on OpenSea testnet.

### Create In-Game NFT

In this video, we will create an in-game item and connect this to an NFT. This requires us to write a C# script in Unity.

### Minting NFT

In this video, we will mint an NFT on the OpenSea marketplace. This will be the NFT that we will use in-game.
