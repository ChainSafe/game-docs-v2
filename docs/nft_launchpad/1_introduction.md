# Introducing NFT Launchpad

[ChainSafe Gaming](https://gaming.chainsafe.io/) is introducing NFT Launchpad, your one stop shop for creating collections, minting NFTs, and launching your NFT project.

# Launchpad, A Management Tool To Bridge NFT Assets To Your Game

NFT Launchpad is an offering by chainsafe gaming to help game developers to mint NFTs and create collections of those NFTs and link them to their games. The users of the 
game can then buy, sell and trade these NFTs inside of the game itself giving them smooth and seamless experience. 
You can create collections for each of your project and for different chains and then mint NFTs for each of these collections. 

## Supported Chains&#x20;

You can create collections and mint NFTs for the following chains:

| Network Name   | Type of Chain |  Chain ID   |
