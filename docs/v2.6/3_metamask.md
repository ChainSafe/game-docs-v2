Here’s how you can include MetaMask in your video games.
1. You can find the scene by navigating to Samples → web3.unity SDK → 2.6 → Web3.Unity Samples → Scenes → SampleLogin - MetaMask.
2. Click on the Login Logic - MetaMask object and in the inspector, modify the Scene To Load to your preferred scene.
