# Hyperplay

## What is HyperPlay?

HyperPlay is a wallet solution that runs in a desktop client. It uses web requests to communicate with the wallet and the client and makes connecting to games easy and simple.

## HyperPlay Desktop App

You will also need to install the hyperplay app which you can find [here](https://www.hyperplay.xyz/downloads?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=chainsafe_gaming_docs) It's a nifty little desktop app that communicates with unity when web requests are sent to it. Once your wallet is logged in to the hyperplay app, when you login or make calls with the SDK, the app will prompt you to interact with your wallet.
