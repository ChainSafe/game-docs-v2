# Web3.unity, An SDK To Bridge Unity NFT Games To The Blockchain

Your journey in blockchain-enabled gaming begins with the [latest release](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.unity/releases) of web3.unity.

web3.unity is an open-source gaming SDK written in C# and developed by [ChainSafe Gaming](https://gaming.chainsafe.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=chainsafe_gaming_docs). It connects games built in the Unity game engine to the blockchain. The library currently supports games built for web browsers (WebGL), iOS/Android mobile, and desktop. web3.unity is compatible with most EVM-based chains such as Ethereum, Polygon, Moonbeam, Cronos, Godwoken, and Binance Smart Chain, letting developers easily choose and switch between them to create the best in-game experience.

## Features of web3.unity

Out-of-the-box, web3.unity comes with Unity prefabs & tooling that will make building web3 games a little bit easier. These features include:

* In-game NFT minting
* Integrable live marketplace for NFTs minted in-game or from the [ChainSafe Gaming Marketplace](https://marketplace.chainsafe.io) web UI
* Voucher-based NFT minting implementation
* WebGL & WebWallet builds for desktop, mobile (iOS or Android), and browser games
* web3 & social logins
* Sign & verify digital signatures
* Multiple ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155 token interactions
