### Installing SDK

In this video, you will be shown where to find the ChainSafe Gaming SDK package and also how to install this package into Unity3D.&#x20;

Install [JSON.NET](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/json-net-for-unity-11347) to fix: `The type or namespace name 'Newtonsoft' could not be found`

### SDK Prefabs

Prefabs are prebuilt components that supply preconfigured functionality. The SDK offers this for the most general operations. This video goes over the most general use cases. The example shows how to connect and NFT from a custom script on the Rinkeby test network from an NFT deployed on OpenSea testnet.

### Create In-Game NFT

In this video, we will create an in-game item and connect this to an NFT. This requires us to write a C# script in Unity.
